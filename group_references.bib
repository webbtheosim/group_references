  abstract      = {Despite increasing focus on data publication and discovery in materials science and related fields, the global view of materials data is highly sparse. This sparsity encourages training models on the union of multiple datasets, but simple unions can prove problematic as (ostensibly) equivalent properties may be measured or computed differently depending on the data source. These hidden contextual differences introduce irreducible errors into analyses, fundamentally limiting their accuracy. Transfer learning, where information from one dataset is used to inform a model on another, can be an effective tool for bridging sparse data while preserving the contextual differences in the underlying measurements. Here, we describe and compare three techniques for transfer learning: multi-task, difference, and explicit latent variable architectures. We show that difference architectures are most accurate in the multi-fidelity case of mixed DFT and experimental band gaps, while multi-task most improves classification performance of color with band gaps. For activation energies of steps in NO reduction, the explicit latent variable method is not only the most accurate, but also enjoys cancellation of errors in functions that depend on multiple tasks. These results motivate the publication of high quality materials datasets that encode transferable information, independent of industrial or academic interest in the particular labels, and encourage further development and application of transfer learning methods to materials informatics problems.},

  abstract      = {For 35 years, {\it ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) has been the method of choice for modeling complex atomistic phenomena from first principles. However, most AIMD applications are limited by computational cost to systems with thousands of atoms at most. We report that a machine learning-based simulation protocol (Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics), while retaining {\it ab initio} accuracy, can simulate more than 1 nanosecond-long trajectory of over 100 million atoms per day, using a highly optimized code (GPU DeePMD-kit) on the Summit supercomputer. Our code can efficiently scale up to the entire Summit supercomputer, attaining $91$ PFLOPS in double precision ($45.5\%$ of the peak) and {$162$/$275$ PFLOPS in mixed-single/half precision}. The great accomplishment of this work is that it opens the door to simulating unprecedented size and time scales with {\it ab initio} accuracy. It also poses new challenges to the next-generation supercomputer for a better integration of machine learning and physical modeling.},

  abstract   = {In many fields one encounters the challenge of identifying out of a pool of possible designs those that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives. In many applications an exhaustive search for the Pareto-optimal set is infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose the ε-Pareto Active Learning (ε-PAL) algorithm which adaptively samples the design space to predict a set of Pareto-optimal solutions that cover the true Pareto front of the design space with some granularity regulated by a parameter ε. Key features of ε-PAL include (1) modeling the objectives as draws from a Gaussian process distribution to capture structure and accommodate noisy evaluation; (2) a method to carefully choose the next design to evaluate to maximize progress; and (3) the ability to control prediction accuracy and sampling cost. We provide theoretical bounds on ε-PAL's sampling cost required to achieve a desired accuracy. Further, we perform an experimental evaluation on three real-world data sets that demonstrate ε-PAL's effectiveness; in comparison to the state-of-the-art active learning algorithm PAL, ε-PAL reduces the amount of computations and the number of samples from the design space required to meet the user's desired level of accuracy. In addition, we show that ε-PAL improves significantly over a state-of-the-art multi-objective optimization method, saving in most cases 30% to 70% evaluations to achieve the same accuracy.},

  abstract      = {Despite its great success, machine learning can have its limits when dealing with insufficient training data. A potential solution is the additional integration of prior knowledge into the training process which leads to the notion of informed machine learning. In this paper, we present a structured overview of various approaches in this field. We provide a definition and propose a concept for informed machine learning which illustrates its building blocks and distinguishes it from conventional machine learning. We introduce a taxonomy that serves as a classification framework for informed machine learning approaches. It considers the source of knowledge, its representation, and its integration into the machine learning pipeline. Based on this taxonomy, we survey related research and describe how different knowledge representations such as algebraic equations, logic rules, or simulation results can be used in learning systems. This evaluation of numerous papers on the basis of our taxonomy uncovers key methods in the field of informed machine learning.},

We motivate the choice of our convolutional architecture via a localized first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutions. Our model scales linearly in the number of graph edges and learns hidden layer representations that encode both local graph structure and features of nodes. In a number of experiments on citation networks and on a knowledge graph dataset we demonstrate that our approach outperforms related methods by a significant margin.},

  abstract      = {We present graph attention networks (GATs), novel neural network architectures that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on graph convolutions or their approximations. By stacking layers in which nodes are able to attend over their neighborhoods' features, we enable (implicitly) specifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without requiring any kind of costly matrix operation (such as inversion) or depending on knowing the graph structure upfront. In this way, we address several key challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT models have achieved or matched state-of-the-art results across four established transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as a protein-protein interaction dataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training).},

Spektral implements a large set of methods for deep learning on graphs, including message-passing and pooling operators, as well as utilities for processing graphs and loading popular benchmark datasets. The purpose of this library is to provide the essential building blocks for creating graph neural networks, focusing on the guiding principles of user-friendliness and quick prototyping on which Keras is based. Spektral is, therefore, suitable for absolute beginners and expert deep learning practitioners alike. In this work, we present an overview of Spektral's features and report the performance of the methods implemented by the library in scenarios of node classification, graph classification, and graph regression.},

  abstract    = {We introduce scalable deep kernels, which combine the structural properties of deep learning architectures with the non-parametric flexibility of kernel methods. Specifically, we transform the inputs of a spectral mixture base kernel with a deep architecture, using local kernel interpolation, inducing points, and structure exploiting (Kronecker and Toeplitz) algebra for a scalable kernel representation. These closed-form kernels can be used as drop-in replacements for standard kernels, with benefits in expressive power and scalability. We jointly learn the properties of these kernels through the marginal likelihood of a Gaussian process. Inference and learning cost $O(n)$ for $n$ training points, and predictions cost $O(1)$ per test point. On a large and diverse collection of applications, including a dataset with 2 million examples, we show improved performance over scalable Gaussian processes with flexible kernel learning models, and stand-alone deep architectures.},

  abstract    = {Poly-N-isopropylacrylamide (PNIPAM) is a thermoresponsive polymer, an essential building block of a large family of soft smart materials. In neat water it undergoes upon heating at $\approx$305K a phase transition from swollen to collapsed state. This interesting polymer behavior has been subject to a large number of computer modelling studies, mostly described with original OPLS force field suggested in the first works, where qualitatively correct behavior was observed. Nevertheless, employing converged replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations, we have shown on PNIPAM 30mer that this widely used force-field can not describe the phase transition thermodynamics. We found that the reason is a poor balance of hydrophobic-polar character of the polymer. We have developed and tested three new force fields OPLS1.2x, QM1, and QM2, which all exhibit two state behavior, and reasonably reproduce experimental lower critical solution temperature and transition thermodynamics. The best performance was found for QM2, which is suggested for future PNIPAM studies. Finally, the effect of polymer chain length on collapse transition thermodynamics was investigated by simulations of 20, 30 and 40mer chains. Consistent with experimental data, the transition enthalpy per monomer unit is only weakly increasing with the chain length. However, the calculated transition enthalpy is around times smaller than the experimental calorimetry value.},

  title       = {JAX, M.D.: End-to-End Differentiable, Hardware Accelerated, Molecular Dynamics in Pure Python},
  abstract    = {A large fraction of computational science involves simulating the dynamics of particles that interact via pairwise or many-body interactions. These simulations, called Molecular Dynamics (MD), span a vast range of subjects from physics and materials science to biochemistry and drug discovery. Most MD software involves significant use of handwritten derivatives and code reuse across C++, FORTRAN, and CUDA. This is reminiscent of the state of machine learning before automatic differentiation became popular. In this work we bring the substantial advances in software that have taken place in machine learning to MD with JAX, M.D. (JAX MD). JAX MD is an end-to-end differentiable MD package written entirely in Python that can be just-in-time compiled to CPU, GPU, or TPU. JAX MD allows researchers to iterate extremely quickly and lets researchers easily incorporate machine learning models into their workflows. Finally, since all of the simulation code is written in Python, researchers can have unprecedented flexibility in setting up experiments without having to edit any low-level C++ or CUDA code. In addition to making existing workloads easier, JAX MD allows researchers to take derivatives through whole-simulations as well as seamlessly incorporate neural networks into simulations. This paper explores the architecture of JAX MD and its capabilities through several vignettes. Code is available at www.github.com/google/jax-md. We also provide an interactive Colab notebook that goes through all of the experiments discussed in the paper.},

  abstract      = {A tool that could suggest new personalized research directions and ideas by taking insights from the scientific literature could significantly accelerate the progress of science. A field that might benefit from such an approach is artificial intelligence (AI) research, where the number of scientific publications has been growing exponentially over the last years, making it challenging for human researchers to keep track of the progress. Here, we use AI techniques to predict the future research directions of AI itself. We develop a new graph-based benchmark based on real-world data -- the Science4Cast benchmark, which aims to predict the future state of an evolving semantic network of AI. For that, we use more than 100,000 research papers and build up a knowledge network with more than 64,000 concept nodes. We then present ten diverse methods to tackle this task, ranging from pure statistical to pure learning methods. Surprisingly, the most powerful methods use a carefully curated set of network features, rather than an end-to-end AI approach. It indicates a great potential that can be unleashed for purely ML approaches without human knowledge. Ultimately, better predictions of new future research directions will be a crucial component of more advanced research suggestion tools.},

  abstract      = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is one of the most effective methods for closed-loop experimental design and black-box optimization. However, a key limitation of BO is that it is an inherently sequential algorithm (one experiment is proposed per round) and thus cannot directly exploit high-throughput (parallel) experiments. Diverse modifications to the BO framework have been proposed in the literature to enable exploitation of parallel experiments but such approaches are limited in the degree of parallelization that they can achieve and can lead to redundant experiments (thus wasting resources and potentially compromising performance). In this work, we present new parallel BO paradigms that exploit the structure of the system to partition the design space. Specifically, we propose an approach that partitions the design space by following the level sets of the performance function and an approach that exploits partially-separable structures of the performance function found. We conduct extensive numerical experiments using a reactor case study to benchmark the effectiveness of these approaches against a variety of state-of-the-art parallel algorithms reported in the literature. Our computational results show that our approaches significantly reduce the required search time and increase the probability of finding a global (rather than local) solution.},

  abstract = {We have studied the hydrophobic water/octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) interface by using the phase-sensitive sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy (PS-SFVS), and we obtained detailed structural information of the interface at the molecular level. Excess ions emerging at the interface were detected by changes of the surface vibrational spectrum induced by the surface field created by the excess ions. Both hydronium (H3O+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions were found to adsorb at the interface, and so did other negative ions such as Cl-. By varying the ion concentrations in the bulk water, their adsorption isotherms were measured. It was seen that among the three, OH- has the highest adsorption energy, and H 3O+ has the lowest; OH- also has the highest saturation coverage, and Cl- has the lowest. The result shows that even the neat water/OTS interface is not neutral, but charged with OH - ions. The result also explains the surprising observation that the isoelectric point appeared at ∼3.0 when HCl was used to decrease the pH starting from neat water.},

  abstract = {The adsorption of water vapor at the surface of magnetite nanoparticles has been investigated both by experimental and by computer simulation methods. The water vapor adsorption/desorption isotherm has been measured on freshly prepared magnetite nanocrystals of the size below 10 nm. The change of the isosteric heat of adsorption with the surface coverage has been determined from the temperature dependence of this isotherm using the isosteric method. The adsorption isotherm has also been determined by performing a set of grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations at 300 K. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results as well as the temperature and coverage dependence of the isosteric heat of adsorption clearly indicates that dissociative chemisorption of the water molecules in the first adsorption layer occurs at the bare magnetite surface, resulting in a high density of surface hydroxyl groups. This dissociative chemisorption is followed by a multilayer physisorption of water at higher pressures. Computer simulation results can reproduce excellently both the adsorption isotherm and the isosteric heat of adsorption beyond the first chemisorbed layer of water. Results of the computer simulations reveal that physisorbed water forms several well-distinguished molecular layers on the magnetite surface; however, these layers are not built up sequentially. Instead, the building up of several molecular layers occurs simultaneously. The adsorption of the water molecules in this range appears to be a nucleation-like process, resulting in a rather rough external surface of the adsorption layer. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract  = {A modified analytic embedded atom potential has been developed for the Li-W system. The potential has been fitted to physical quantities derived from density functional theory calculations. It is shown that the new potential is capable of reproducing the solubility of solid solution for Li-W systems. The wetting behaviors between solid tungsten and liquid Li are examined by using molecular dynamics simulations. The MD simulation results for the Li droplet wetting on the W surface illustrated that our MAEAM potential model has a good forecasting ability for the contact angle of liquid Li on W the cleaning surface above the wetting temperature. And the results of Li film dewetting from the W surfaces are consistent with relative experimental results. It is believed that the potential can be used to investigate the surfaces wettability of liquid Li on W substrate. We also simulated the lithium droplet on grooved surface. It is shown that the grooving W surfaces can obviously improve the wetting of liquid Li on W surfaces.},

  month         = may,
  abstract      = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

  abstract      = {During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. CNNs are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D CNNs with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application-specific. To address this issue, 1D CNNs have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and motor-fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D CNNs that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D CNNs along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D CNN software used in those applications are also publically shared in a dedicated website.},
